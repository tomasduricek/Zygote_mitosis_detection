Detect mitosis of first zygote using CNN and automatize image preprocessing process

Preprocessing involves opening image from a tiff file, cropping to 256x256 size, finding the brightest image, rescale datapoint to 0-255 and save preprocessed images as jpeg 
Currently working on CNN with TF, Keras to train a model.
